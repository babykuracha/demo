**🚀 HEMATOVISION: TRANSFORMING BLOOD CELL CLASSIFICATION WITH TRANSFER LEARNING**

---

### 🧠 1. Empathize: Understanding the Problem

🔍 Manual classification of blood cells under a microscope is:

* Time-consuming
* Prone to human error
* Requires expert knowledge

❗ Misclassification can lead to incorrect medical diagnoses.

👥 To address these issues, we engaged with lab technicians and pathologists to identify their key needs:

* Speed
* Accuracy
* Accessibility
